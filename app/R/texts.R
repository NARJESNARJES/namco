The first column-name can be empty or something like \'taxa\'; the entries in this column are the OTU names, they have to correspond to those in the OTU-table and the phylogenetic tree file (if provided).

By default, Namco cuts the fastq-files at the first occurrence of <b>_L001</b>, meaning everything before (excluding _L001) that will be used as the sample-name and compared with the SampleID column; but you can change this cutoff with the sample-name cutoff text-field. If not all sample-names could be found in this column, the upload stops with an error. Since this approach is too restrictive to work with every experiment design, Namco also provides the option to set this cutoff-text manually. This can be done in the \'sample-name cutoff\' field: If you for example enter \'_XX\' there, each fastq-file will be cut at the first occurrence of \'_XX\' and the sample-names will be everything in front of this text. You have to be aware that this specific text does not appear in the \'real\' sample-name, otherwise the cutting will happen too far in front.</p></div>"))

This tool is part of the <em>mixOmics</em> package, widely used in bioinformatics for exploring and understanding the relationships between different types of biological data.</p>
                      <p>The primary goal of DIABLO is to find correlated features across different datasets that are associated with a particular outcome of interest (e.g., disease status, treatment response). It does this by optimizing the covariance between these datasets, allowing for a better understanding of the underlying biological processes and the potential discovery of biomarkers.</p>

                      <li><strong>Biomarker Discovery</strong>: If you are looking to identify potential biomarkers that are consistent across different types of biological data for diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic purposes.</li>
                      <li><strong>Complex Disease Understanding</strong>: Useful in research focused on complex diseases, where multiple biological mechanisms interact, and understanding these interactions is crucial.</li>
